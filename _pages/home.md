<p>Graduate Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof Lukasz Golab](http://www.engineering.uwaterloo.ca/~lgolab/) and [Prof Keshav Srinivasan](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/). Earlier I was working as a Software Engineer at [Arcesium](http://www.arcesium.com/) (The D.E. Shaw Group).
I completed my undergraduation (Bachelor's of Technology), in Information Technology from Indian Institute of Information Technology ([IIIT](http://iiita.ac.in/)), Allahabad. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Predictive Modelling, and Blockchains.</p>
<p>I wrote my Bachelor Thesis, while working as a Research Intern, in [University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/university/), Germany, on Recommender Systems. I developed an algorithm to incorporate content metadata into state of the art factorization models (Factorization Machines, Joint/Collective Matrix Factorization) to improve their performance.</p>
<p>Apart from working at Arcesium, I have had another industrial work experience in Citigroup, where I interned as a full stack engineer working on MEAN stack. I also built dynamic visualizations using d3.js.</p>
<p>In the recent months, I have also worked in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In Deep Learning, I have been studying the applications of sequence models building text generation and stock prediction models. In Reinforcement Learning, I am currently working on techniques like Q-Learning, Monte Carlo and Policy Gradient to solve various environments in OpenAI's [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) library like Cartpole and Pong.</p>
<p>I am also passionate about music and playing drums(progressive metal). I had a band in college and we mainly played hard rock and heavy metal.
