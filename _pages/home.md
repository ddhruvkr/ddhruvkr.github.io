<p>I am a Software Engineer at [Arcesium](http://www.arcesium.com/) (The D.E. Shaw Group).
I completed my undergraduation (Bachelor's of Technology), in Information Technology from Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Predictive Modelling, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>I wrote my Bachelor Thesis, while working as a Research Intern, in University of Paderborn, Germany, looking into ways metadata could be added to state of the art models factorization models (Factorization Machines, Joint Matrix Factorization) to improve their performance.</p>
<p>Apart from working at Arcesium, I have had another industrial work experience in Citi, where I interned as a full stack engineer working on MEAN stack. I also built cool visualizations using d3.js.</p>
<p>In the recent months, I have become interested in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In Deep Learning, I worked on the applications of sequence models building text generation and stock prediction models. In Reinforcement Learning, I am currently working on combining Deep Learning with Q-Learning to learn various OpenAI environments in their library Gymg.</p>\
