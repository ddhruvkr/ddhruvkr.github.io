<p>I am currently working as an Applied Research Scientist at [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). Previously, I was a ML Research Intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/en/) working on Neural Semantic Parsing. Prior to that, I was a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). My interest lies on the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My thesis was on unsupervised text simplification and was supervised by [Prof. Lukasz Golab](http://www.engineering.uwaterloo.ca/~lgolab/) and was in close collaboration with [Prof. Olga Vechtomova](http://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/index.html) and [Prof. Lili Mou](https://lili-mou.github.io/). In the past, I have worked on designing a consent management system using permissioned blockchains with [Prof. Keshav Srinivasan](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/), detecting incivility on social media with [Prof. Robin Cohen](http://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rcohen/) and recommender systems with [Prof. O.P. Vyas](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=9-NwhCAAAAAJ).</p>
<p>Before starting graduate school, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Arcesium](http://www.arcesium.com/) ([The D.E. Shaw Group](https://www.deshawindia.com/)). I completed my undergraduation (Bachelor's of Technology), in Information Technology from the Indian Institute of Information Technology ([IIIT](http://iiita.ac.in/)), Allahabad. I wrote my Bachelor Thesis, while working as a Student Research Intern, at the [University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/university/), Germany, on Recommender Systems. I also interned at [Citigroup](http://www.citigroup.com/citi/) as a full stack engineer working in the Equities Technology.</p>
<p>I play progressive rock and metal music on drums and was part of a band during my undergrad.</p>
