<p>I am a Software Engineer at [Arcesium](http://www.arcesium.com/) (The D.E. Shaw Group).
I completed my undergraduation (Bachelor's of Technology), in Information Technology from Indian Institute of Information Technology ([IIIT](http://iiita.ac.in/)), Allahabad. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Predictive Modelling, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>I wrote my Bachelor Thesis, while working as a Research Intern, in [University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/university/), Germany, on Recommender Systems. I looked into ways metadata could be added to state of the art factorization models (Factorization Machines, Joint Matrix Factorization) to improve their performance.</p>
<p>Apart from working at Arcesium, I have had another industrial work experience in Citi, where I interned as a full stack engineer working on MEAN stack. I also built cool visualizations using d3.js.</p>
<p>In the recent months, I have become interested in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In Deep Learning, I worked on the applications of sequence models building text generation and stock prediction models. In Reinforcement Learning, I am currently working on combining Deep Learning with Q-Learning to solve various OpenAI environments like Cartpole and Pong in their library [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).</p>
