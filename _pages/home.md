<p>Graduate Computer Science student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). My interest lies in Natural Language Processing and towards its application in social good and computational social science. My thesis supervisor is [Prof Lukasz Golab](http://www.engineering.uwaterloo.ca/~lgolab/).  Currently, I am collaborating closely with [Prof Olga Vechtomova](http://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/index.html) and [Prof Lili Mou](http://lili-mou.github.io/) on controllable text generation for simplification and lyrics generation. In the past I have worked on designing a consent management system using permissioned blockchains with [Prof Keshav Srinivasan](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/) and on Detecting Inciviltiy on Social Media with [Prof. Robin Cohen](http://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rcohen/).  </p>
<p>Before starting graduate school, I was working as a Software Engineer at [Arcesium](http://www.arcesium.com/) ([The D.E. Shaw Group](https://www.deshawindia.com/)). I completed my undergraduation (Bachelor's of Technology), in Information Technology from the Indian Institute of Information Technology ([IIIT](http://iiita.ac.in/)), Allahabad. I wrote my Bachelor Thesis, while working as a Student Research Intern, at the [University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/university/), Germany, on Recommender Systems. I also had the chance to intern at [Citigroup](http://www.citigroup.com/citi/) as a full stack engineer working in the Equities Technology.</p>
<p>I am also passionate about music and playing drums(progressive metal). I was part of a band during my undergrad and we mainly played hard rock and heavy metal.</p>
