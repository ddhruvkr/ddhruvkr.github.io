- title: "Time Series Forecasting using Deep Learning"
  image: 
  description: "It predicts a google stock opening price given the data for the last 20 days. Trained the model on multiple variables in the data from the last 5 years. 
I have used LSTM, on Tensorflow with Keras on top.
I will hopefully improve this by adding sentiment knowledge to it, by using headlines of the stock for each day. 
It should not be much of an extension, since after getting the sentiment score from the headline about the stock, we can basically just add it as a new column to our matrix and our model learns it as a new feature.

Although I haven't fully optimized the hyper-parameters for now."

    Implemented a deep Recurrent Neural Network from scratch to learn about sequence networks, doing a character level generation of text.
    Ran the model on my Bachelor's Thesis to learn my writing style. The model was quickly able to learn the grammar rules and important technical terminologies from my thesis.

- title: Face Recognition in Videos
  image: 
  description:
    Built a face recognition web application on Flask and openCV for pmOne Analytics GmbH. The project's goal was to identify faces from a video, given a person’s image. Since, we partnered Microsoft in this project, we used their Project Oxford API to train the model. The project was done as part of a tender bid towards a project by the German Government, aimed at identifying the people behind the Sexual Assault incident in Cologne on the new year’s eve of 2015/2016.
    Also used celery with RabbitMQ to make the application asynchronous.

- title: Compressed Knowledge transfer via Factorization Models in Recommender Systems
  image: 
  description:
     This was my Bachelor Thesis, where I continued my previous project on Recommender Systems. 
     I looked at ways to incorporate knowledge from metadata to improve the performance of Factorization Machines.
     Initially using the MovieLens 1M, I extracted the genre information from the summaries of movies and cast information by
     parsing the IMDB. Then, I designed a personalized model to utilize this information. 
     We were able to more than double the performance achieved with tradition matrix factorization approaches like Collective Matrix Factorization,
     which I used as a baseline. We have been able to validate the approach with bigger datasets and will soon publish it.

- title: Analysis of Time Aware and Semantic Feature Based Music Recommender System
  image: 
  description: This project was aimed at developing a recommender system, to incorporate semantic data as a side information for getting more accurate results.
                Proposed a modified Joint Matrix Factorization approach to incorporate information related to
                items and implicit user 's item preference to enhance the accuracy of the system.
                The model is based on time variant Recommender System, thus also utilises the time-related
                information of items. Experimental results show that this method gets approximately 0.60%
                more accurate recommendation results with faster converging speed than other existing
                approaches based on matrix factorization.

  description:
    Built this as part of my summer internship at Citi after my 3rd year. It was majorly a web application used for data visualization and a CRUD. Used MEAN stack and worked on d3.js for visualization. Build customization d3 modules wrapped in Angular directives. Was given a full time job offer after my internship.

- title: Information Extraction and Opinion Analysis on E Commerce Websites
  image: 
  description:
    It is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    The goal of the project, is to develop a prototype that can feel the pulse of the
    E-Commerce website users with regard to the reviews they provide on the products
    they buy. What we generally find in the reviews section of these websites is rather 
    deceptive. The star rating of the user is not always concordant with what he/she has
    written. Also there is no feature wise review available for products. We aim to bridge
    this gap with our project.

  description: The application aims to provide all the information regarding Effervescence MMXIV the Cultural Fest of our College to the participants as well as to anyone who attends the fest.
               The application has day wise as well as genre wise details of the events.
              One can set reminders for all any events one is interested in as well contact the members of the management team through a single click via call, message and email facility.
              It also has Google Maps linked to it, which helps one find exactly the location where any particular event is happening.
              One could also mark his favorite events for a better navigation through the app.

- title: Faculty Feedback Form
  image: 
  description: This project aims to develop an anonymous faculty feedback form through which all the students would login using their college login ID and password and give their opinion about a particular teacher teaching a particular subject. The results for each teacher would be compiled and displayed when the teacher logs in using a bar graph. The teachers will also have the privilege to compare their results over the years.

- title: Wiki Unlimited
  image: 
  description: Feed of never-ending featured articles from Wikipedia. Ideal for killing time. Developed it in 2015.

Inspired by Wikifeedia (search Github for the project). The difference though is that Wikifeedia gives random featured articles starting from the same alphabet(which is random too) whereas this gives random articles with no constraints whatsoever. Some of the code is borrowed from it. I had to change the underlying API and the way it was being utilized.

Will soon update more details about the implementation.
