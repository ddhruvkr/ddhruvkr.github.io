- title: "Text Simplification (Ongoing)"
  image: 
  description: "The main goal of sentence simplification is rewriting text such that it becomes easier to read, while still retaining its original information and meaning.
  Current deep learning models are black-box models which focus on simplifying text while maintaining fluency. However, they do this at the expense of meaning preservation.
  Also, they are black-box models which means we do not know clearly what properties of the text need to be modified to do better simplifications.
  We are looking at models which can be controlled, use as less training data as possible and give insight into the simplification process."

  image: 
  description: "The increasing amount of personal data is raising serious issues in the context of privacy, security, and data ownership. 
Entities whose data are being collected can benefit from mechanisms to manage the parties that can access their data and to audit who has accessed their data. 
Consent management systems address these issues.
Consentio is a scalable consent management system based on the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain. 
The data management challenge we address is to ensure high throughput and low latency of endorsing data access requests and granting or revoking consent. 
Experimental results show that our system can handle as many as 6,000 access requests/s, allowing it to scale to very large deployments."

Will improve this by adding sentiment knowledge to it, by using headlines of the stock for each day. 
It should not be much of an extension, since after getting the sentiment score from the headline about the stock, we can basically just add it as a new column to our matrix and our model learns it as a new feature.

Although I haven't fully optimized the hyper-parameters for now."

  description:
    Built a face recognition web application on Flask and openCV for pmOne Analytics GmbH. The project's goal was to identify faces from a video, given a person’s image. Since, we partnered Microsoft in this project, we used their Project Oxford API to train the model. The project was done as part of a tender bid towards a project by the German Government, aimed at identifying the people behind the Sexual Assault incident in Cologne on the new year’s eve of 2015/2016.
    Also used celery with RabbitMQ to make the application asynchronous.

- title: Compressed Knowledge transfer via Factorization Models in Recommender Systems
  image: 
  description:
     This was my Bachelor Thesis, where I continued my previous project on Recommender Systems. 
     I looked at ways to incorporate knowledge from metadata to improve the performance of Factorization Machines.
     Initially using the MovieLens 1M, I extracted the genre information from the summaries of movies and cast information by
     parsing the IMDB. Then, I designed a personalized model to utilize this information. 
     We were able to more than double the performance achieved with tradition matrix factorization approaches like Collective Matrix Factorization,
     which I used as a baseline. We have been able to validate the approach with bigger datasets and will soon publish it.

- title: Analysis of Time Aware and Semantic Feature Based Music Recommender System
  image: 
  description: This project was aimed at developing a recommender system, to incorporate semantic data as a side information for getting more accurate results.
                Proposed a modified Joint Matrix Factorization approach to incorporate information related to
                items and implicit user 's item preference to enhance the accuracy of the system.
                The model is based on time variant Recommender System, thus also utilises the time-related
                information of items. Experimental results show that this method gets approximately 0.60%
                more accurate recommendation results with faster converging speed than other existing
                approaches based on matrix factorization.

    It is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    The goal of the project, is to develop a prototype that can feel the pulse of the
    E-Commerce website users with regard to the reviews they provide on the products
    they buy. What we generally find in the reviews section of these websites is rather 
    deceptive. The star rating of the user is not always concordant with what he/she has
    written. Also there is no feature wise review available for products. We aim to bridge
    this gap with our project.

    I had to change the underlying API and the way it was being utilized.
    Will soon update more details about the implementation.
